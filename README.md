# Password-based-Door-Locking-System
This system demonstrates a password based door lock system wherein once the correct code or password is entered, the door is opened and the concerned person is allowed access to the secured area. Again if another person arrives it will ask to enter the password. If the password is wrong then door would remain closed, denying the access to the person.
This project is demonstrated using a simulator with lpc2148 microcontroller.
Required software applications:
1. Keil Compiler
2. Proteus Simulator
